# Programmatic Input

This mod allows you to directly interface with Celeste's input engine within the game. It works for entities, mods, and even Lua cutscenes.

For any questions or problem reports, submit an Issue to [this mod's GitHub](https://github.com/TheDavSmasher/ProgrammaticInput) or message me through Discord (@davdualmain).
